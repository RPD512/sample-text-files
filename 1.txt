We implement a meta-regression-analysis for the budgetary impact of numerical ﬁscal rules
based on 30 studies published in the last decade. The existing empirical evidence points to a
constraining eﬀect of rules on ﬁscal aggregates. However, this seemingly optimistic message is
strongly weakened as our analysis points to a bias if the potential endogeneity of ﬁscal rules is
not explicitly taken into account. Furthermore, our analysis provides evidence for the presence of
a publication bias. Both sources of bias reduce the statistical precision of obtained eﬀects below
usual levels of statistical signiﬁcance. In addition, we oﬀer suggestive evidence for the eﬀect size
based on a small coherent sub-sample and provide recommendations for future research on the
budgetary impact of ﬁscal rules.

1. Introduction
In recent decades, industrialised countries have exhibited a substantial increase in public debt reaching levels which increasingly
threaten ﬁscal sustainability. There is a growing consensus that this is due to a debt or spending bias of politicians which distorts
democratic budgetary decision making (see Imbeau, 2004, for a survey). Legislators in numerous industrialised countries therefore
have proposed and introduced numerical ﬁscal rules in order to meet these adverse incentives as well as the long-run trend in
increasing debt. Under the impression of the recent crisis, the introduction and strengthening of these rules ranked high on the
political agenda. At the supranational level, for instance, the European Union has reformed the Stability and Growth Pact with
stricter thresholds and more stringent decision making procedures. Furthermore, the Fiscal Compact obliges ratifying EU Member
States to introduce numerical ﬁscal rules or to adapt existing ones along the requirements of the compact in order to increase their
eﬃcacy. The eﬀectiveness of ﬁscal rules in conﬁning political-economic forces inducing a debt bias, however, has been a matter of
discussion.
In recent years, a large body of empirical research investigating the eﬀectiveness of ﬁscal rules has emerged.1 However, a
majority of these studies share a common point of criticism as they neglect or do not deal adequately with the potential issue of
endogeneity. The latter might invalidate the empirical analysis, as the fact that a country has a ﬁscal rule in place might primarily
reﬂect its preferences for ﬁscal discipline (Poterba, 1996; Debrun et al., 2008). Furthermore, the establishment of a ﬁscal rule or its
strictness might systematically coincide with the country's ﬁscal condition. Those countries already exhibiting a low level of public
debt might therefore be more likely to coincide with stricter rules. Consequently, a common cause interdependence may exist in
which preferences drive both the presence of ﬁscal rules as well as the ﬁscal performance of a country. Thus, in these kinds of

Early studies usually focused on balanced budget rules in the context of US states (e.g., Bails, 1982; Abrams and Dougan, 1986; Shadbegian, 1996). Subsequently,
analyses have been extended to further countries or even further lower tier subnational jurisdictions (for qualitative surveys see Kirchgässner, 2002; Burret and Feld,
2014).

settings, ﬁscal rules cannot be interpreted as exhibiting a causal inﬂuence on the level of public debt.
Against this background, our contribution is twofold. First, we conduct the ﬁrst meta-regression-analysis (MRA) on this
particular ﬁeld of literature summarising existing empirical evidence in a systematic way. To this end, we concentrate on the impact
of numerical ﬁscal rules on ﬁscal aggregates in a national as well as subnational context.2 Second, we explicitly account for diﬀerent
identiﬁcation strategies followed by primary studies and assess the relevance of the above mentioned endogeneity concerns.
Given the large methodological heterogeneity in this ﬁeld of literature, several challenges have to be overcome in order to
implement a MRA. As ﬁscal rules are measured in various ways, the extraction of a uniformly deﬁned and comparable impact
coeﬃcient is not feasible. To this end, we follow meta-analytical studies such as Card et al. (2010) and rely on the t-value rather than
the point estimate itself. This measure is fully comparable across studies and indicates the sign as well as the level of statistical
signiﬁcance with which ﬁscal rules impact on ﬁscal aggregates. For the largest homogeneous sub-group of studies, we additionally
run meta-regressions with respect to the eﬀect size. Furthermore, given the wide range of control variables employed in primary
studies, we subsume particular features in groups of control variables which deﬁne a typical study and against which we test the
robustness to alterations in the estimation speciﬁcations in existing studies.
Based on 30 studies which have been published in the period between 2004–2014, the following insights emerge: In general, the
MRA provides evidence for a constraining and statistically signiﬁcant impact of ﬁscal rules on ﬁscal aggregates at the national level.
This result is particularly strong for deﬁcits and to a much lesser degree for debt, expenditures or revenues. However, the results
point to a substantial bias if the potential endogeneity of ﬁscal rules is neglected, conﬁrming that these concerns have to be taken
seriously. The statistical signiﬁcance of the impact of rules is reduced below the usual levels if a primary study is characterised by a
more sophisticated identiﬁcation strategy. This insight strongly weakens the seemingly optimistic message in the existing empirical
literature with respect to the eﬀectiveness of ﬁscal rules. Concerning the administrative level, we ﬁnd evidence for a higher eﬃcacy of
ﬁscal rules at the municipal level compared to the national level. Beyond that, the MRA provides evidence for a potential publication
bias as results obtained from working papers are on average associated with lower levels of statistical signiﬁcance. With respect to
the eﬀect size, our MRA points to a deﬁcit reducing impact in the range of −1.5 to −1.2% of GDP if a ﬁscal rules is present.
In the next section, we describe our algorithm for the literature search. In Section 3, we explain the coding of the meta-variables
and take a descriptive look at our sample. While the empirical methodology is described in Section 4, the meta-regression results are
presented in Section 5. Section 6 concludes.
2. Selection of studies
Crucial for the validity of a MRA is the application of a well-deﬁned and reproducible algorithm guiding the literature search as
well as the coding for the subsequent econometric modelling. To this end, we base our analysis on the guidelines proposed by Stanley
et al. (2013).3
We conducted a literature search using the EconLit database. This database covers all economic journals indexed by the
American Economic Association and provides a comprehensive overview of the economic literature. The keywords employed to
conduct the literature search involved ﬁscal rule, ﬁscal restraint, debt brake, debt rule, budget rule, and deﬁcit rule. The search was
carried out on April 16th, 2014 and repeated on January 28th, 2015 to ensure that all publications from 2014 were included. In raw
ﬁgures, this resulted in a total of more than 1,500 search results. We then ﬁltered out all duplicate search results found across
keywords and excluded papers not published in English. Furthermore, we limited the time frame of the search to 10 years, i.e., only
studies published between 2004 and 2014 were included. Consequently, our MRA provides a consensus estimate formed by the
empirical evidence from the last decade.4
To derive a sample of comparable studies, we further applied a common deﬁnition of a ﬁscal rule. To this end, we rely on the
deﬁnition provided by Kopits and Symansky (1998) where ﬁscal rules are characterised as a permanent numerical constraint on
ﬁscal policy deﬁned in terms of an indicator of overall ﬁscal performance such as the government deﬁcit, debt or expenditure.
Against this background, we focus in our MRA on numerical ﬁscal rules in national and subnational contexts, and preclude studies
which exclusively investigate the impact of supranational rules such as the Stability and Growth Pact. This decision is guided by the
usual focus on cross-jurisdictional variation in rules in the empirical literature.5
Finally, we limit our analysis to primary studies with public ﬁnance indicators such as expenditures, revenues, debt, or deﬁcit as
dependent variables including their overall state or their subcomponents. In contrast, we exclude studies testing the impact of ﬁscal
rules on ﬁnancial market indicators or the structure of the budget. The latter do not ﬁt into the framework of our research question
as they lack a clear hypothesis against which the result with respect to the eﬃcacy of a ﬁscal rule could be interpreted (e.g., Dahan
and Strawczynski, 2013).
Altogether, this algorithm yields 51 studies for coding. In assessing and coding these studies, we follow a four-eyes principle to
reduce measurement error and imprecision caused by interpretation. Initially, each paper is read by one of the authors. This involves
a ﬁrst assessment in terms of relevance with respect to the guidelines deﬁned above. If these are fulﬁlled, the same author codes all
relevant features of the primary study with respect to the dimensions included in the MRA. In a subsequent step, each paper is read
2

As a consequence, we preclude studies focussing exclusively on the impact of supranational rules or budgetary procedures (e.g., von Hagen, 2002)
Further guidelines for meta-analyses are oﬀered by Stanley and Doucouliagos (2012) or Nelson and Kenedy (2009).
Please note that this does not apply to the time coverage of primary studies.

While we preclude studies focusing exclusively on supranational rules, the latter is taken explicitly into account in our MRA if they have been used as a control
variable (e.g., Dahan and Strawczynski, 2013).

again individually by one of the remaining authors and coding decisions are double checked.6 This results in a total of 30 studies
forming the basis of our analysis. Table A.1 provides a comprehensive overview of these papers.
3. Data and descriptive statistics
3.1. Variable coding
In order to render the estimation of a meta-regression feasible, idiosyncratic features of the considered primary studies must be
merged into a set of common and comparable control variables. This process comes along with several key challenges. In the context
of a MRA, one would ideally like to extract a uniformly deﬁned impact coeﬃcient which would be immediately comparable across
primary studies. In our context, however, this is not feasible due to the large methodological heterogeneity within this strand of
literature.
First, there is substantial heterogeneity with respect to the dependent variable in primary studies. While slightly less than one
third of our observations relate to the primary deﬁcit as dependent variable, one quarter refers to either expenditures or revenues.
Also the coding of the dependent variable diﬀers, i.e., dependent variables are expressed in relation to the GDP, revenues, or in per
capita or absolute terms. Together these circumstances impede the direct comparability of eﬀects across studies.
Second, there is substantial heterogeneity with respect to the codiﬁcation of ﬁscal rules. As shown below, primary studies in our
MRA capture the impact of ﬁscal rules either through dummy, discrete, or continuous variables. Given these diﬀerences, comparing
marginal eﬀects of ﬁscal rules across studies is not possible as the switch from 0 to 1 in case of a dummy variable is not necessarily
comparable to a change from an index value a to b in case of a continuous index. Therefore, we follow meta-analytical studies such as
Card et al. (2010) which face a similar challenge and which rely on the t-value rather than on the coeﬃcient of the impact of ﬁscal
rules.7 The t-value is immediately and fully comparable across studies and indicates whether a ﬁscal rule has a positive, negative, or
no statistically signiﬁcant impact on the respective ﬁscal indicator. Furthermore, it is independent from the unit of measurement
employed in the primary study.
A clariﬁcation is necessary with respect to the sign convention applied in the context of our MRA. In light of the core research
question, the goal of this MRA is to subsume existing empirical evidence on whether ﬁscal rules constrain budgetary policy and shift
it towards a more sustainable path. If ﬁscal rules are indeed eﬀective in this regard, they should reduce deﬁcits, debt as well as
expenditures and increase revenues. In order to account for these aspects, we code t-values of primary studies in a way that a
negative sign always indicates a constraining impact, i.e., a ﬁscal rule lowers deﬁcit, debt, and expenditures, or increases revenues,
respectively.8
We account for the richness of speciﬁcations across considered primary studies by subsuming speciﬁc dimensions into the
following variable groups: (i) the classiﬁcation of the dependent variable, (ii) the type of the ﬁscal rule, (iii) the administrative level
the primary study's data is referring to, (iv) a general set of control variables usually employed in studies within this strand of
literature subsuming economic and political-economic features, (v) indicators testing for a potential publication bias, and (vi)
characteristics of the econometric speciﬁcation. Additionally, we pay particular attention to strategies used to deal with the issue of
endogeneity and subsume respective strategies in the group (vii) identiﬁcation strategies. Within these groups, usually several
individual variables account for diﬀerent aspects of the respective topic. In order to test for the robustness of our results, we extend
the set of groups and include the country as well as time coverage of primary studies. A detailed description of all meta-analytical
variables is provided in Table A.2 in the appendix.
The variables capturing the publication bias as well as the group of identiﬁcation strategies need a more detailed discussion. The
presence of a publication bias is a well-documented phenomenon in social sciences (e.g., Franco et al., 2014; Gerber and Malhotra,
2008). If statistically signiﬁcant empirical ﬁndings have a higher probability of being accepted for publication (holding other study
features constant), published estimates will provide a misleading guidance on the true parameters. With respect to economics, there
is evidence for a publication bias towards statistically signiﬁcant outcomes for example within the strands of literature on minimum
wages, returns to education, productivity, and growth (Gerber and Malhotra, 2008). The mechanism behind the publication bias
comprises two stages. First, authors may abstain from writing and submitting papers on statistically insigniﬁcant ﬁndings
(submission bias). Second, journals may be more likely to accept papers with statistically signiﬁcant results even if other
methodologically comparable papers provide statistically imprecise evidence (acceptance bias). An analysis of a submission bias is
only very rarely feasible as this would require full information on the entire sample of studies independent of their publication
status.9 Therefore, our meta-regression-analysis can only provide evidence with respect to the acceptance bias by comparing
systematic diﬀerences in levels of reported statistical signiﬁcance for working papers and journal articles.
With respect to identiﬁcation strategies, numerous studies investigating empirically the eﬀectiveness of ﬁscal rules share a
common point of criticism. Many primary studies neglect or only deal insuﬃciently with the potential presence of a common cause
6
We include the complete set of estimations from each study in our sample. Authors may include so called “straw man” estimation speciﬁcations with the only goal
of contrasting them with “better” or richer ones. However, a selective inclusion would introduce an element of arbitrariness on the side of the meta-analysts and must
be avoided. Our meta-analysis relies on a rich set of coded dimensions and therefore objectively reﬂects the heterogeneity of speciﬁcations across and within studies.
7
Further studies relying on t-values instead of coeﬃcients involve Baskaran et al. (2014) as well as Klomp and de Haan (2010).
8
In case of primary studies relying on revenues as the dependent variable, we invert the sign of the t-values capturing the impact of ﬁscal rules. By the same token,
we also invert the sign of studies using the budgetary balance as the dependent variable. Yet, this does not apply to studies using the deﬁcit.

interdependence, omitted variables bias, or reversed causality. Some empirical studies tried to tackle these potential issues. For
instance, one strand of the literature argues in favour of a time-invariance of ﬁscal preferences. Given such a setting, implementing a
simple ﬁxed eﬀects estimation accounting for unobserved and time-invariant individual heterogeneity would suﬃce to take the
impact of ﬁscal preferences into account (e.g., Krogstrup and Wälti, 2008). Another strand of the literature relaxes the assumption of
time-invariant preferences and tries to measure ﬁscal preferences explicitly.10 Primary studies implementing IV-strategies or quasiexperimental methods pose another approach with respect to the causal inference. For instance, Foremny (2014) implements an IVestimation relying on political determinants of the level of government as well as indicators for the general ﬁscal stance of a country
as instruments. Grembi et al. (2012) applies a diﬀerence-in-discontinuities approach in a subnational context for Italian
municipalities.
In order to account for these diﬀerences in identiﬁcation approaches, we derive four diﬀerent dummy variables which subsume
diﬀerent dimensions of the described strategies. The Identiﬁcation dummy 1 forms the most comprehensive approach and is set to
one if at least one of the above described four strategies (ﬁxed eﬀects, measurement of ﬁscal preferences, IV-strategies, and quasiexperimental methods) are employed in the primary study. The subsequent dummies each drop a particular strategy sequentially.
While the Identiﬁcation dummy 2 excludes jurisdiction ﬁxed eﬀects from its deﬁnition, Identiﬁcation dummy 3 subsumes IVstrategies as well as quasi-experimental methods, whereas Identiﬁcation dummy 4 is only set to 1 if quasi-experimental methods are
implemented.
3.2. Descriptive statistics
In the following, we present speciﬁc sample characteristics. In order to avoid that the results suﬀer from extreme outliers, we
trim the distribution of t-values by excluding the top and bottom 1% percentiles.11 In all summary tables, we present the number of
observations and the percentage share in relation to the total number of 1,033 observations, the number of studies employing the
respective variable, minimum and maximum t-values as well as unweighted and weighted mean t-values. The latter are computed as
the number of observations extracted from primary studies and are not equally distributed. For instance, just two studies out of 30
(Nerlich and Reuter, 2013: 215 observations; Tapsoba, 2012: 220 observations) account for almost half of the full sample (435
observations in relation to 1,033 observations). In order to avoid biased descriptives or point estimates (Section 5), we apply an
analytical weighting procedure and weight each observation with the inverse of the share of observations per study in relation to the
full sample. As a result, we assign an equal weight to each study in the full sample.12
Table 1 gives a summary of the classiﬁcation of the dependent variable. We distinguish between six dependent variables: debt,
secondary deﬁcit, primary deﬁcit, secondary expenditure, primary expenditure, and revenue. Most of the studies rely on the deﬁcit
(39.5% of the total) or expenditures (33.5% of the total) as the dependent variable. On average, observations taken from studies with
debt as the dependent variable lack statistical signiﬁcance at conventional levels. The opposite holds true for observations obtained
from studies relying on the deﬁcit. Irrespective of the weighting, observations in studies with secondary and primary deﬁcit as the
dependent variable are on average statistically signiﬁcant at the 5% level. In contrast, the weighting reduces the statistical precision
of studies with secondary expenditures as a dependent variable. For all dependent variables with the exception of revenues, mean tvalues exhibit a negative sign indicating a constraining eﬀect of rules on average irrespective of weighting.
To gain further insights into the distribution of t-values, we also present a boxplot graph in Fig. 1. The dashed line marks the 5%
threshold for statistical signiﬁcance (t-value=−1.96). The margins of the boxes indicate the 25% and the 75% quartiles whereas the
vertical line in between depicts the median t-value.13 In particular studies employing the secondary deﬁcit as dependent variable
exhibit statistically signiﬁcant results. More than 50% of the observations are statistically signiﬁcant at the 5% level. A similar result
is found for studies relying on the primary deﬁcit or primary expenditure with a median t-value being only slightly below the 5%
threshold. In case of debt as the dependent variable, only 25% of the observations are statistically signiﬁcant at the 5% level.
Concerning the skewness of the distribution, t-values from observations with debt and (to a lesser extent) primary deﬁcit as
dependent variable are skewed to the left while the opposite holds true for observations with primary and secondary expenditure.
In Table 2, we present summary statistics for the type of the ﬁscal rule and the administrative level to which the primary studies’
data refer to. With respect to the former, we distinguish between debt rules, deﬁcit rules, expenditure rules, and revenue rules.14
Again, there are diﬀerences between weighted and unweighted means. While most of the unweighted mean t-values of various rule
types indicate a statistical signiﬁcance at the 10% level (the exception is the debt rule which is marginally insigniﬁcant), statistical
signiﬁcance is lost when we employ analytical weights. However, observations in case of deﬁcit rules are close to statistical
signiﬁcance with a weighted mean t-value of −1.515. With respect to the distribution of rule types across studies, deﬁcit rules are
used in more than 70% of the cases, while revenue rules are only employed in about one third of the sample. Mean t-values and
information on the distribution of observations for the administrative level are presented in the bottom part of Table 2. In total,
63.2% of the observations stem from studies for the national level, while the remaining part is equally shared between observations
10

Heinemann et al. (2014), for instance, use historical inﬂation rates or some measure of political preferences of the executive government.
Without trimming, the minimum and maximum t-values are equal to -40.710 and 11.230, respectively. The t-value distribution distinguished along types of
dependent variables and without trimming as well as weighting is shown in Fig. A.1 in the appendix.

Single dots represent outliers identiﬁed by standard whisker plots using a distance of 1.5 times the inter-quartile range above the 75% quartile and below the
25% quartile.
14
As some primary studies employ composite indicators which comprise several rule types, the sum of the percentage shares exceeds 100%.

speciﬁc groups of controls has an eﬀect on the statistical signiﬁcance of ﬁscal rules. The mean t-value becomes statistically signiﬁcant if
authors control for ideology, government stability, electoral cycles, or supranational rules such as the Stability and Growth Pact. In
contrast, the results are only marginally aﬀected by controlling for debt, openness, or the dependency ratio.
With respect to the application of identiﬁcation strategies, we distinguish between the inclusion of jurisdiction ﬁxed eﬀects, proxies
measuring preferences and cultural aspects directly, and the application of IV-estimators or quasi-experimental designs. For the majority
of identiﬁcation strategies, their application is associated with statistically insigniﬁcant average t-values for the impact of ﬁscal rules. The
sole exception is given by proxies for preferences and culture. When authors account for these preferences, average t-values range at the
10% level of statistical signiﬁcance. However, larger absolute t-values, i.e., more constraining eﬀects of ﬁscal rules are observed if authors
apply identiﬁcation strategies. Here, the sole exception is given by the application of IV-estimators.
Lastly, Fig. 2 provides ﬁrst evidence for a publication bias in the data. The histogram plots the distribution of the t-values
associated with observations obtained from published journal articles in our sample. The red line depicts the threshold of the 5%level of statistical signiﬁcance. The ﬁgure shows a missing mass in the distribution below the threshold and an excess mass just above
it. Given this ﬁrst evidence for a publication bias, we explicitly control for it in our meta-regression in the next section.

In contrast to classical meta-analyses, we rely on MRA techniques. While the former combines individual study results to an

heterogeneity in primary results can be explained by one or several characteristics of the respective studies (Harbord and Higgins,
2008).
As explained above, due to the heterogeneity in coeﬃcients across primary studies, we employ the t-value of the ﬁscal rule's
impact as our meta-analytical dependent variable. In line with the usual assumptions in case of MRA, we expect that heterogeneity in
individual results of primary studies is driven by sampling error (ϵs, i), study- or design-speciﬁc factors (X) and the set of estimatespeciﬁc covariates (Z). Our baseline estimation can therefore be summarised by Eq. (1).

^t = t + X β + Z γ + ϵ
s, i
0
s, i
s, i
s, i

(1)

Here, ^ts, i refers to the estimated t-value in case of speciﬁcation i from primary study s. t0 is the intercept and captures the
respectively deﬁned baseline t-value of the typical study across all primary studies considered in our MRA. This baseline is deﬁned as
an estimation of the impact of a deﬁcit rule on the primary deﬁcit for the national level. Furthermore, the statistical signiﬁcance of
the respective coeﬃcient is computed with robust standard errors and the study belongs to the class of refereed journal articles. The
deﬁnition of a baseline is necessary due to the way of coding of the study- or design-speciﬁc features in the context of a MRA. This is
done by individual dummy variables which are then usually combined to a sub-group in order to capture a particular design feature
of the primary study. In this process, dummies constituting such a sub-group are usually self-excluding. Consequently, considering
all of these dummy variables at the same time in our meta-regression would result into perfect multi-collinearity. Therefore, we
deﬁne one particular feature as baseline for every sub-group where self-exclusion applies. Taken together, all these baseline features
are captured by the intercept of our MRA. All reported coeﬃcients have to be interpreted relative to this baseline and report an
impact of the deviation in this particular feature from the baseline.
Given the heterogeneity in methodological approaches and sample sizes in primary studies, the variances of individual estimates
of ^ts, i are not homoscedastic. Consequently, the estimation of Eq. (1) will be more eﬃcient using weighted least squares instead of
ordinary least squares (Greene, 2003). The selection of proper weights, however, is not straightforward as our MRA does not rely on
standardised coeﬃcients. While the literature usually uses the inverse of error term variances obtained from primary studies, this is
not feasible in case of a MRA using t-values. Since we follow a multiple sampling approach in which information from all available
estimations in primary studies are used, the number of observations resulting from particular studies diﬀer substantially. In order to
avoid settings in which results and design features of particular primary studies constituting a large share in our sample drive the
results of our MRA, we use analytical weights based on the inverse of the share of observations per study in relation to the full
sample. These weights assign an equal weight to every primary study in our estimation sample.
The fact that usually more than just one observation is obtained from each individual study has a further impact on the
estimation of Eq. (1). As these individual observations are likely to be correlated due to the low within-variation in design features,
error terms in the estimation of Eq. (1) are likely to be correlated as well. We therefore cluster standard errors at the level of studies
considered in our MRA. However, since our sample consists of 30 studies, clustering will result in further econometric issues. First,
one may argue that the number of clusters is too low potentially resulting in an underestimation of the underlying serial correlation
in individual observations (Angrist and Pischke, 2009). Second, given the large heterogeneity in the number of primary estimates
obtained from particular studies, the size of clusters will vary accordingly. Therefore, we also apply the so called wild-clusterbootstrap procedure in order to deal with both issues (Cameron et al., 2008). This permits to implement a bootstrapping procedure
for the standard errors of Eq. (1) while taking the clustered structure of the data into account and re-samples along them (Cameron
and Miller, 2015).
We extend and vary the estimation methodology of Eq. (1) in several ways in order to test for the robustness of our results. First,
we include two more groups of control variables in our MRA, namely the country and time coverage of primary studies. While this
extension provides further insights compared to the baseline speciﬁcation, it comes at the expense of dropping the administrative
level due to the highly pronounced correlation with these additional dimensions. In general, we also report the variance-inﬂationfactor in order to test for a potential bias due to high correlation between control variables.
A further extension relates to the analysis of the publication bias. In a ﬁrst step, we change the baseline of this group and test for
the impact of journal publications explicitly. In a second step, we use information about the impact factor of journals included in our
MRA. The latter may allow to deduce a diﬀerential publication bias which may be dependent on the reputation of the particular
journal the primary study has been published in.15
With respect to the estimation methodology, we implement two diﬀerent approaches. First, we extend Eq. (1) by adding study
ﬁxed eﬀects. This allows to control explicitly for unobserved study speciﬁc aspects which are by deﬁnition time-constant in the
context of a MRA. Implementing a ﬁxed eﬀects regression, however, increases the demands on the control variables in a MRA as they
must exhibit within variation. More precisely, this means that dimensions we control for in our MRA must vary across speciﬁcations
within a particular study. As this is not necessarily the case for all dimensions in all primary studies, the meta-regressions employing
ﬁxed eﬀects can only be implemented on a reduced set of control variables.
Second, we follow Card et al. (2010) and implement an ordered probit approach as a further extension to the estimation
methodology. To do so, t-statistics obtained from primary studies are split into three groups according to Eq. (2). These groups
involve negative signiﬁcant (-1), insigniﬁcant (0), and positive signiﬁcant (1) observations. The distinction is made by using the
critical value of the t-distribution at the 5 % threshold. Obtained results are interpreted directly with respect to their sign and level of
15
While we have explicit panel information about the impact factors of journals considered in our MRA, we do not have respective information for working papers.
In case of the latter, we assign a zero impact factor to working papers considered in our MRA.

Finally, we also run estimations for the eﬀect size. For this analysis, the sample has to be limited to the largest homogenous
subgroup which comprises of studies testing for the impact of ﬁscal rules on both primary and secondary deﬁcit expressed relative to
the GDP as well as rules measured in terms of dummy variables. As in case of the baseline, we weight observations and estimate
using weighted least squares. However, given the reduced sample size, the estimation speciﬁcation must be altered. This is due to the
lack in coverage of particular dimensions as well as resulting collinearity between remaining groups of control variables in the
MRA.16 Given the reduced sample size as well as reduced number of considered primary studies, results from this part of our
analysis should only be interpreted with caution and seen as suggestive.
5. Results
5.1. Main results
Table 4 summarises our baseline estimation results. All ﬁve columns report estimations of Eq. (1) using weighted least squares.
The sample constitutes of 30 primary studies from which 1,033 observations are obtained. We report both clustered as well as wildcluster-bootstrapped t-values. While the former is noted in brackets, braces are used in case of the latter.
Our MRA puts a special emphasis on the issue of endogeneity within this ﬁeld of literature and the identiﬁcation strategies
followed in primary studies. Results in column (1) serve as the main speciﬁcation in which components constituting the
identiﬁcation dummies are used individually. Columns (2) to (5) report results using sequentially the set of four identiﬁcation
dummies derived in Section 3.
Table 4 is dived into subsections by headlines indicating the respective group of study and design dimensions as well as their
respective baseline category. The deﬁnition of the baseline study is constant throughout all speciﬁcations. It uses the primary deﬁcit
as dependent variable, captures the impact of a deﬁcit rule, relies on data for the national level, reports robust standard errors, and
belongs to the class of refereed journal publications.
In case of the main speciﬁcation, the average consensus t-value for this baseline study is equal to −1.874. More precisely, primary
studies exhibiting the design features deﬁned above are found to report a negative and statistically signiﬁcant impact of ﬁscal rules at
the 10% threshold on average. Except for columns (2) and (5), this holds true for all other speciﬁcations in Table 4. The baseline in
case of column (5) even indicates a negative and statistically signiﬁcant impact at the 5% level. These eﬀects are estimated with
statistical precision in our MRA in case of both clustered as well as wild-cluster-bootstrapped standard errors.
Relative to the baseline, variation in the dependent variable matters for the impact of ﬁscal rules. This is the case for debt,
primary as well as secondary expenditures, and revenues. All variables are associated with positive coeﬃcients in case of our MRA,
hereby indicating a reduction in the level of statistical signiﬁcance with which ﬁscal rules aﬀect these ﬁscal aggregates. For instance,
in case of debt, the results of the MRA indicate a range of average t-values from −0.729 to 0.113. As a consequence, these results
imply a level of signiﬁcance below the 10% threshold. This general observation holds true for all dependent variables for which
coeﬃcients are estimated with statistical precision in our MRA. With the exception of primary expenditures, coeﬃcients are
estimated with statistical precision at the 1% level in case of both clustered as well as wild-cluster-bootstrapped standard errors.
In contrast to the dependent variable, variation in the type of ﬁscal rules does not matter and does not seem to exhibit an
additional impact. This is the case throughout all ﬁve speciﬁcations and may be driven by the fact that numerous primary studies do
not capture the type of the rule precisely or lump it together with other types of rules.
New insights can be gained from the analysis of the administrative level the data of primary studies refer to. Here, the results of
our MRA indicate that on average and in absolute terms higher t-values are associated with studies relying on data referring to the
municipal level. This indicates that relative to the baseline which captures a signiﬁcant impact at the national level, rules at the
municipal level exhibit an even stronger statistically signiﬁcant impact. The results imply levels of signiﬁcance at the 1% threshold
and are estimated with statistical precision in our MRA.
With respect to control variables, the picture is less clear cut. Usual control variables employed in primary studies such as the
debt level, government stability or election years are not associated with an additional impact in terms of statistical signiﬁcance.
Other variables such as the ideology or dependency ratio exhibit a diﬀerential impact which, however, is not robust throughout all
speciﬁcations of our MRA. While estimated coeﬃcients in case of the former are negative for all ﬁve speciﬁcations of Table 4, they are
only estimated with statistical precision in case of speciﬁcations (2) and (3). In case of the dependency ratio, reported coeﬃcients are
positive. However, they are only precisely estimated in cases of speciﬁcations (1), (3) and (5). Further, this precision is lost if wildcluster-bootstrapped standard errors are computed.
These results indicate that primary studies accounting for a discretionary impact of ideology are on average associated with
16
We explicitly control whether all remaining variables in the MRA for the eﬀect size are backed by more than one study. This is especially important given the
reduced sample size and reduced number of considered studies.

higher levels of statistical signiﬁcance concerning the constraining impact of ﬁscal rules. In contrast, studies controlling for the
dependency ratio yield on average t-values in the range of −0.830 to −0.239 implying a loss in statistical signiﬁcance. More robust
evidence is provided by our MRA with respect to the presence of supranational ﬁscal rules. With the exception of column (4), all
coeﬃcients are precisely estimated in our MRA and point to higher levels of statistical signiﬁcance with respect to the constraining
impact of national ﬁscal rules if primary studies control for the presence of supranational rules.
The results of our MRA also oﬀer insights with respect to the presence of a publication bias. Throughout all speciﬁcations,
obtained coeﬃcients are positive and precisely estimated considering both clustered as well as wild-cluster-bootstrapped standard
errors. Relative to the baseline which is deﬁned as publication in a refereed journal, our results indicate that average t-values for
publications in working papers range between −0.705 and 0.402. These results indicate that on average publications in a refereed
journal are more likely to provide evidence for a negative and signiﬁcant impact of ﬁscal rules, while results in working papers are

more likely to be insigniﬁcant. This points to an acceptance bias as the MRA controls for an exhaustive set of further study features
which also proxy for the methodological rigour.
With respect to properties of the econometric speciﬁcation, our MRA indicates that primary studies running estimations
including time ﬁxed eﬀects report stronger negative and signiﬁcant eﬀects for the impact of ﬁscal rules. The same holds true in case
of bootstrapped errors in comparison to robust standard errors of the baseline eﬀect. However, eﬀects for both variables are not
conﬁrmed if wild-cluster-bootstrapped standard errors are considered in our MRA. Furthermore, it has to be emphasised that the
obtained result for the baseline eﬀect persists irrespective of whether the observations from primary studies were part of an
interaction eﬀect. This observation strengthens our results against the background of the multiple sampling approach employed in
our MRA.
The results with respect to identiﬁcation strategies employed in primary studies indicate that accounting for a potential
endogeneity matters for the statistical signiﬁcance with which the eﬃcacy of ﬁscal rules is measured. In case of column (1), in which
variables constituting the identiﬁcation dummies are employed individually, our results point to lower levels of statistical
signiﬁcance if primary studies control explicitly for preferences or implement quasi-experimental estimation methods. This general
observation is conﬁrmed in case of the identiﬁcation dummies 2, 3, and 4 which comprise of the individual components. Coeﬃcients
of all three dummies exhibit positive signs and are, except for identiﬁcation dummy 4, estimated with statistical precision in our
MRA using both clustered as well as wild-cluster-bootstrapped standard errors. Relative to the baseline eﬀect, accounting for a
potential endogeneity yields a range of t-values between −1.053 and −0.384. Combining these outcomes with the insigniﬁcant result
for identiﬁcation dummy 1, the size of the baseline eﬀect in column (2), and the results for preferences as well as quasi-experimental
designs in column (1), our MRA provides strong evidence for the presence of potential endogeneity and the relevance of accounting
for it when analysing the impact of ﬁscal rules empirically. Overall, this insight signiﬁcantly weakens the seemingly optimistic

message with respect to the eﬀectiveness of ﬁscal rules given by the baseline eﬀect.
5.2. Further study dimensions
To gain further insights, we extend our analysis by adding two new variable groups as well as data on journal impact factors. The
results for these alterations are summarised in Table 5. To economise on space, we only report the results for the newly added study
dimensions. The full set of results is provided by Table A.5 in the appendix.
As adding two new variable groups on country coverage and time coverage would cause problems with collinearity, it was
necessary to drop information on the administrative level in the cases of column (1) and (2). Compared to the estimations in
Table 4, the baseline level of statistical signiﬁcance of the impact of ﬁscal rules is lower. All four coeﬃcients indicate a statistical
signiﬁcance below the 10% threshold.
Including the country coverage as a further dimension asks for the deﬁnition of an additional baseline category. In this case, EU
countries serve as the baseline. Relative to this subset of countries, only the coverage of Switzerland in primary studies is associated
with an additional impact. More precisely, our results indicate that the impact of ﬁscal rules relative to the baseline is more
pronounced in the context of Switzerland with average t-values at the 1% level. The picture in case of the time coverage is less clear
cut. While primary studies covering data for the 1950s as well as 1970s provide evidence for a stronger statistical impact of ﬁscal
rules well above the 1% threshold, primary studies covering the 1960s as well as 1980s provide evidence for the opposite.
Switching the baseline category from journal publications to working papers in order to test the indicated publication bias
conﬁrms the results of Table 4. Relative to the baseline, publications in journals are on average associated with negative and
statistically signiﬁcant eﬀects at the 10% level. This is estimated with statistical precision in our MRA in case of both clustered as well
as wild-cluster-bootstrapped standard errors. A diﬀerential eﬀect with increasing reputation of the journal by adding information on
the impact factor is negated by our MRA. While studies published in refereed journals are generally more likely to report negative
and statistical signiﬁcant eﬀects for the impact of ﬁscal rules, the level of statistical signiﬁcance is not further raised with increasing
reputation of the journal. Consequently, a publication bias seems to be present for the extensive but not for the intensive margin. Put
diﬀerently, high levels of statistical signiﬁcance tend to help authors to publish in a refereed journal in general but do not necessarily
increase the acceptance rate in higher ranked relative to lower ranked journals.
5.3. Other speciﬁcations
As described in Section 4, we extend the estimation methodology to include study ﬁxed eﬀects (Table A.3) and implement an
ordered probit analysis (Table A.4). In case of the former, alterations in the estimation speciﬁcation are entirely driven by the lack of
within-variation in the respective variables. In case of the latter, alterations are due to the properties of the ordered probit approach
which does not allow estimating a baseline eﬀect. Results for the latent variable are interpreted directly with respect to its sign as well
as statistical precision.
The evidence from the ﬁxed eﬀects estimation points to a negative and statistically signiﬁcant impact of ﬁscal rules above the 1%
threshold. However, evidence from both approaches with respect to identiﬁcation strategies conﬁrm the general tendency for a
reduction in statistical signiﬁcance of the eﬀects of ﬁscal rules. While these variables are only imprecisely estimated in case of the
ﬁxed eﬀects estimation, identiﬁcation dummy 3 comprising IV's and quasi-experimental methods are estimated with statistical
precision in case of the ordered probit approach.
New insights are obtained with respect to control variables. While the results for ideology, the dependency ratio and
supranational rules are conﬁrmed, the inclusion of government stability proxy is associated with a more pronounced impact of ﬁscal
rules. The opposite is true for studies accounting for the impact of elections in case of the ﬁxed eﬀects estimations. Primary studies
report on average a reduced constraining impact of ﬁscal rules when controlling for election years.17 Both estimation approaches
conﬁrm the presence of a potential publication bias and indicate an increased likeliness for non-existent or positive signiﬁcant
eﬀects if published in a working paper.
5.4. Eﬀect-size analysis
Table 6 summarises the results with respect to the eﬀect size for the largest homogeneous sub-group of observations. This subgroup consists of studies testing for the impact of ﬁscal rules on both the primary and secondary deﬁcit expressed relative to the GDP
and measured in terms of a dummy variable. As a consequence, sample size is reduced signiﬁcantly including only nine primary
studies and results should only be interpreted with caution and seen as suggestive. The alterations in the estimation speciﬁcation are
due to the reduced sample size and the resulting lack in coverage of particular dimensions as well as collinearity.
Against this background, the baseline eﬀect is estimated to range between −1.5 and 1.3 and can be interpreted as a reduction in
the deﬁcit in percent of the GDP if a deﬁcit rule is present. With the exception of columns (3) and (4), these eﬀects are estimated with
statistical precision. The eﬀect size is roughly reduced by 0.5 percentage points if the impact on the secondary rather than the
primary deﬁcit is considered. For the sub-group of these nine studies the eﬃcacy of ﬁscal rules at the state level is strongly reduced
and even found to be deﬁcit increasing compared to the national level.

While not very robust, results for control variables such as ideology are conﬁrmed. However, in case of variables such as
supranational rules, signs of obtained coeﬃcients switch. The same holds true for eﬀects with respect to country coverage and time
coverage. For instance, in Euro member states, ﬁscal rules are found to be associated with increased deﬁcits. Results with respect to
the time coverage are again not clear cut. While studies using data for the 1960s and 2010s are associated with stronger constraining
eﬀects, this is not the case for the 1970s. Results with respect to a potential publication bias are also conﬁrmed by the analysis for the
eﬀect size. Observations obtained from journal publications are associated with a larger constraining eﬀect from ﬁscal rules
compared to observation from working papers. The diﬀerence amounts up to 2.5 percentage points of GDP. This eﬀect is increasing
with the reputation of the journal measured by its impact factor.
6. Conclusions
The empirical literature on the budgetary implications of numerical ﬁscal rules has been growing quickly over the recent years
and has reached a critical mass rendering MRA feasible and appropriate to summarise the overall evidence. Our paper is the ﬁrst
MRA in this particular ﬁeld of literature which explores and summarises existing empirical evidence from 30 studies from the last
decade in a systematic way. In this regard, we provide a consensus estimate with respect to the sign as well as statistical signiﬁcance
with which ﬁscal rules inﬂuence ﬁscal aggregates. Furthermore, for a small homogeneous sub-group of studies, we also provide a
consensus estimate with respect to the size of eﬀects. However, our MRA contributes to this ﬁeld of literature beyond a simple
stocktaking. First, it provides guidance to the crucial discussion with respect to the identiﬁcation of causal eﬀects within this ﬁeld of
literature. It puts special emphasis on the impact resulting from the use of diﬀerent types of identiﬁcation strategies. Second, our
analysis provides insights with respect to the role of included control variables. For researchers in the ﬁeld of public ﬁnance and
political-economics this may guide the determination of an appropriate speciﬁcation for future analyses of the budgetary impact of
ﬁscal rules.
Our MRA points to a statistically signiﬁcant and constraining impact of ﬁscal rules on ﬁscal aggregates at the national level.
Obtained results indicate a level of signiﬁcance around the 10% threshold. These results hold particularly strong for deﬁcits but less
so for debt, expenditures or revenues. Relative to the baseline of deﬁcit rules, alternative types of ﬁscal rules do not exert a
diﬀerential impact. Concerning the eﬀect size, albeit only measurable for a small subset of studies, the results show that deﬁcit rules
on average reduce the primary deﬁcit between −1.5 and −1.2 percent of GDP.
With respect to the identiﬁcation of causal eﬀects, our analysis provides supportive evidence that ﬁscal rules must not be treated
as exogenous. Our results show that coeﬃcients tend to lose their statistical signiﬁcance with increasing reﬁnement of applied
identiﬁcation strategies. While the inclusion of jurisdiction ﬁxed eﬀects as a rough measure for ﬁscal preferences does not make a
systematic diﬀerence, the employment of instrumental variables or quasi-experimental designs lead to markedly lower levels of
signiﬁcance and a less constraining impact. In light of these insights, our results emphasise the necessity for using appropriate
identiﬁcation strategies in future research in order to advance our knowledge on the causal impact of numerical ﬁscal rules.
A further insight emerges from our meta-regressions-analysis with respect to minimum standards for future studies and
necessary controls. Our results indicate that controlling for government stability, political budget cycles, demographic characteristics
as well as the presence of a supranational rule is relevant for the measured impact of ﬁscal rules. Consequently, the set of control
variables should involve proxies for these dimensions whenever possible. With respect to diﬀerences across federal levels, our results
indicate that constraining eﬀects of ﬁscal rules are the strongest for studies using municipal data.
Our MRA also provides evidence for a publication bias. Results obtained from working papers are on average associated with
lower levels of statistical signiﬁcance compared to those from journal articles. Against this background, it must be emphasised that
our MRA can only substantiate one of the two main mechanisms leading to publication bias. The channel is given by the inclination
of reviewers and journal editors to favour papers with statistically signiﬁcant results. The comparison between working papers and
journal articles is, however, not informative on the inclination of authors to keep statistically insigniﬁcant ﬁndings in the ﬁle drawer
so that these results do not even reach the stage of the working paper. Bearing this in mind, our evidence for an upward publication
bias in published journal articles is of a conservative nature.
Summarising, the existing empirical evidence points to constraining eﬀects of rules on ﬁscal aggregates. However, results have to
be interpreted carefully as on the one hand our analysis points to a bias if the potential endogeneity is not taken explicitly into
account and on the other hand provides evidence for the presence of a publication bias. Both insights strongly weaken the seemingly
optimistic message in the existing empirical literature with respect to the eﬀectiveness of ﬁscal rules. Against this background, it will
be crucial to develop and implement new convincing identiﬁcation strategies in order to provide robust and causally interpretable
empirical evidence in this ﬁeld of literature. For political-economic scholars searching for eﬀective debt-constraining institutions
these ﬁndings imply that the perspective should also widen towards alternatives such as e.g., independent ﬁscal boards or the role of
disciplining incentives from bond markets.
