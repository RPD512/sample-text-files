1. Introduction
Fiscal decentralization can improve government quality by promoting inter-jurisdictional competition for ﬁscal resources thus making
sub-central governments more responsive to citizens' preferences
(Brennan and Buchanan, 1980). The creation of multi-level government
structures in a ﬁscally decentralized setting (typical of federal systems)
may reduce government quality because it leads to ﬁscal or regulatory
“over-grazing” (Shleifer and Vishny, 1993), because it hinders the
capacity of citizens to assign merit or blame to different government
levels (Gerring and Thacker, 2004) or because the creation of multiple
veto points (for example via bicameralism) may lock in the status quo
and prevent improvements in government effectiveness (Treisman,
2002). Combining ﬁscal decentralization with sub-national elections
may improve government quality by empowering better informed
voters (Seabright, 1996) but it may also lead to the capture of subnational politicians by special interests having the opposite effect
(Bardhan and Mookherjee, 2000). In this light, a case emerges for a
degree of political centralization in the form of either centrally
appointed local ofﬁcials or strong national parties that exercise

inﬂuence on sub-central ofﬁcials thereby limiting their excesses
(Blanchard and Shleifer, 2001; Riker, 1964).
Existing empirical evidence is supportive of the positive impact of
ﬁscal decentralization on government quality. Fisman and Gatti (2002)
ﬁnd that more ﬁscally decentralized countries tend to be less corrupt. Fan
et al. (2009) show that ﬁscal decentralization reduces corruption while a
large number of government or administrative tiers increase it. Fiscal
decentralization combined with strong national parties signiﬁcantly
improves government quality (Enikolopov and Zhuravskaya, 2007). On
the other hand, electoral decentralization, federalism or bicameralism
reduces the positive effect of ﬁscal decentralization on the quality of
government (Kyriacou and Roca-Sagalés, 2011).
The inter-jurisdictional competition literature emphasizes the
importance of sub-central governments relying on their own resources
for the proper functioning of competition. Thus, vertical transfers may
create incentives for local ofﬁcials to ignore competitive pressures for
better management (Oates, 1999; Qian and Rolands, 1998). Because it is
available for the widest cross-country sample, ﬁscal decentralization has
typically been measured as expenditure or revenue share of sub-central
governments in total public expenditures (or as a percentage of GDP)
based on the IMF's Government Finance Statistics (GFS). But these
deﬁnitions do not control for inter-governmental transfers or grants to
and from central government respectively (Rodden, 2004). More
generally, the GFS indicators do not reﬂect on whether sub-central
governments “own” ﬁscal resources and as a result tend to overestimate
the degree of ﬁscal autonomy (Stegarescu, 2005). In this paper, we

All regressions include cross-section and period ﬁxed effects and report white heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors in parentheses. *, **, *** measure statistical signiﬁcance at

empirically re-examine the relationship between ﬁscal decentralization
and government quality by way of ﬁscal decentralization measures
which account for intergovernmental grants and transfers.
2. Data and empirical methodology
We use two indicators of ﬁscal decentralization provided by Gemmell
et al. (2009) and based on the OECD General Government Accounts. First,
subnational expenditure (as a proportion of consolidated general
government spending) which subtracts from state and local expenditure, transfers paid to central government. Second, subnational revenue
(as a proportion of consolidated general government revenue) which
subtracts from state and local revenues, grants from other governments.1
Our government quality indicators come from the World Bank's
Worldwide Governance Indicators. We generate an aggregate measure
of government quality by averaging four dimensions of government
quality namely, control of corruption, rule of law, regulatory quality and
government effectiveness. The intersection of our government quality
and ﬁscal decentralization indicators leads to an unbalanced panel of up
to 27 OECD countries over the period 1996 to 2005.2 We use dummy
variables to capture whether or not a country holds regional elections
(WDR, 1999/2000), can be classiﬁed as federal (Elazar, 1995) or has a
regional chosen upper house that could block lower house ﬁnancial
legislation (Treisman, 2002).3
We estimate the following model:
Government Qualityit = αi + γt + β1 FDit + β2 FDit × PD
+ β3 Xit + εit ði = 1; …n; t = 1; …T Þ

ð1Þ

where FDit is a measure of ﬁscal decentralization in country i at time t,
PD is a dummy variable which takes the value of 1 when a country is
political decentralized (regional elections, bicameral or federal) and 0
when it is not, and Xit is a vector of control variables that varies across
countries and over time. If β1 N 0 while β2 b 0 this implies that the
positive impact of ﬁscal decentralization on government quality is
mitigated in the presence of political decentralization.
To control for cross-country heterogeneity as well as periodspeciﬁc factors common to all cross-section units we employ ﬁxed

This measure is highly correlated with Stegarescu's (2005) revenue decentralization indicator which takes into account whether sub-central governments determine
the tax rate and/or base (simple correlation over the period 1995–2001 of 0.93).

effects estimation. As a robustness check we also use instrumental
variable (IV) and random effect estimations. The former deals with
reverse causality and we employ lagged values of our endogenous
explanatory variables as instruments (Barro, 2000; Enikolopov and
Zhuravskaya, 2007). The latter exploits some of the cross-section
variability of our panel and assumes no correlation between country
speciﬁc residuals and our explanatory variables (Wooldridge, 2002).
3. Results
The variables included in the regressions reported in this section
are those which are statistically signiﬁcant or whose exclusion
seriously changes the estimates. In order to check whether the results
are being driven by one particular country in our sample, we repeat
our regressions after removing each of the 27 countries one at a time
for the whole sample. The results are stable indicating that no single
country is driving them.
The empirical results in Table 1 are fully in line with the previous
literature: ﬁscal decentralization has a positive and statistically
signiﬁcant impact on government quality. Moreover, the results
conﬁrm the ﬁnding such that electoral decentralization and multilevel government mitigate the positive effect of ﬁscal decentralization
on government quality. Indeed, a look at the point estimates suggests
that the presence of regional elections, federalism and bicameralism
cancels the positive contribution of ﬁscal decentralization on the
quality of government.
The results obtained by the ﬁxed effects procedure are maintained
when we estimate our model based on the IV technique or by way of
the random effects method (Table 2). Our results are robust both to
the disaggregation of our quality of government indicators down to
their component dimensions and to the use of expenditure rather than
revenue to measure ﬁscal decentralization.4
4. Conclusion
Existing empirical work calibrating the impact of ﬁscal decentralization on government quality employs indicators which do not reﬂect the
“ownership” of ﬁscal resources by sub-central governments. This is
despite the fact that the positive predictions made in the literature about
the impact of inter-jurisdictional competition on government quality
stem from the assumption that sub-national governments rely on their
own resources. We take a step towards addressing this situation by using
